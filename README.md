UK Leisure Map

Aim
---

The aim is to create a Maperitive ruleset to allow rendering of OpenStreetMap data relevant to outdoor leisure activities (walking, cycling, etc.) in the UK. The map should show useful features and public rights of way.

Current state
-------------

At the moment the rights of way are shown adequately and the map is useable but missing quite a few relevant features. Some of these are marked TODO in the rules file. There is also no map key at present.

Usage
-----

The suggested location for the rules file is in a folder called UserRules inside your Maperitive directory. A sample script file is included, which could be placed in the Scripts folder inside your Maperitive directory. The script will need modifying to reflect the correct paths for the rules file and OSM data file and can then be run using File > Run Script...
