Aim
---

The aim is to create a Maperitive ruleset to allow rendering of OpenStreetMap data relevant to outdoor leisure activities (walking, cycling, etc.) in the UK. The map should show useful features and public rights of way.

Current state
-------------

At the moment the rights of way are shown adequately and the map is useable but missing quite a few relevant features. Some of these are marked TODO in the rules file. There is also no map key at present.
